# Issue #4: Set Up Basic Test Scene with Core Elements

**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** scene, testing, mvp

## Description
We need a simple scene to test boat movement, fuel consumption, and basic interactions before building the full expedition experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Scene contains water plane/surface for boat to move on
- Harbor docking point with visual indicator
- Player spawn point with properly configured boat prefab
- At least one test rescue target to verify rescue mechanics
- Basic lighting setup for headlight testing
- Scene serves as foundation for further development

## Why This Matters
A controlled test environment allows us to verify each system works before adding complexity. This prevents debugging multiple systems simultaneously.
