# Issue #7: Complete Rescue Interaction System

**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** rescue, interaction, mvp

## Description
The rescue system has basic structure but needs refinement to create satisfying hold-to-rescue mechanics and proper passenger management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hold E near rescue target initiates rescue progress
- Visual/audio feedback shows rescue progress during hold interaction
- Rescue succeeds after holding for configured duration
- Rescued survivors are added to passenger count
- Boat cannot rescue more survivors than seat capacity
- Rescue is interrupted if boat moves away during interaction

## Why This Matters
Rescue is the primary objective and reward mechanism. A polished rescue interaction makes the core gameplay loop satisfying and clear.
