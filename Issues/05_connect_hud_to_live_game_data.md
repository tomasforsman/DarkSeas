# Issue #5: Connect HUD to Live Game Data

**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** ui, feedback, mvp

## Description
The HUDController exists but displays static or placeholder data. Players need real-time feedback on fuel, hull damage, passenger count, and harbor direction to make meaningful decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fuel bar accurately reflects current fuel levels and updates in real-time
- Hull bar shows damage when boat collides with hazards
- Passenger counter updates when survivors are rescued
- Compass shows direction and distance to harbor
- All UI elements are visually clear and update smoothly

## Why This Matters
Player feedback is crucial for creating tension and enabling strategic decisions. Without accurate HUD data, players cannot understand the consequences of their actions.
