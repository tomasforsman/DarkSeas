# Code Reviews Directory

This directory contains code reviews generated by AI agents for Unity game development. Reviews provide static analysis of code quality, architecture, and development progress.

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[agent-name]-[short-title].md
```

**Examples:**
- `2025-08-19-1430-claude-input-system.md`
- `2025-08-19-0930-gpt4-ui-architecture.md`
- `2025-08-20-1115-deepseek-player-movement.md`

## Review Structure

Each code review must follow this structure:

### 1. Specific Requirements
Address any explicitly requested review criteria or questions from the developer.

### 2. Changes Since Last Review
Summarize modifications since the previous review:
- New features implemented
- Bug fixes applied
- Refactoring completed
- Architecture modifications

Reference the previous review file when available.

### 3. Current Code State
Evaluate the codebase across these areas:

**Game Systems:**
- Core gameplay mechanics implementation
- Game loop structure and state management
- Entity/Component systems usage
- Scene management and transitions

**Architecture:**
- Module separation and dependencies
- Design pattern implementation
- Component organization
- Platform abstraction layers

**Code Quality:**
- Naming conventions and readability
- Documentation and comments
- Consistency with project standards
- Error handling implementation

**Resource Management:**
- Asset loading patterns
- Memory allocation in code structure
- Object pooling implementations
- Resource disposal patterns

### 4. Areas Requiring Attention
Identify specific deficiencies with concrete examples:
- Architectural issues (tight coupling, missing abstractions)
- Code quality problems (unclear naming, missing documentation)
- Implementation gaps (incomplete features, hardcoded values)
- Unity-specific concerns (component lifecycle, serialization)
- Testing gaps and validation issues

### 5. Development Priorities
Recommend actionable next steps in priority order:
- **Critical:** Issues that could cause crashes or major problems
- **High Impact:** Architectural improvements affecting multiple systems
- **Quality:** Code readability, documentation, and maintainability
- **Enhancement:** Feature completions and optimizations

## Agent Guidelines

### Analysis Focus
- **Static code analysis only** - examine code structure, patterns, and architecture
- Provide specific examples with file paths and line numbers
- Include code snippets when illustrating issues
- Cross-reference related files to understand system interactions
- Consider Unity-specific patterns and best practices

### Game Development Priorities
Pay special attention to:
- **Unity Patterns:** MonoBehaviour usage, component lifecycle, serialization
- **Gameplay Systems:** Player controls, game state, mechanics implementation
- **Performance Patterns:** Algorithmic efficiency, memory allocation patterns
- **Architecture:** ECS usage, event systems, dependency injection
- **Asset Pipeline:** Resource loading, scene structure, prefab organization

### What Cannot Be Assessed
- Runtime performance metrics or frame rates
- Memory usage during gameplay
- Actual gameplay feel or balance
- Platform-specific runtime behavior
- Build-time performance or compilation issues

### Code Examples Format
When including code examples:

```markdown
**Issue:** [Brief description]
**Location:** `path/to/file.cs:line-range`

**Current Code:**
```csharp
// Code example here
```

**Recommendation:** [Specific improvement suggestion]
```

### Review Quality Standards
- Be direct and actionable in recommendations
- Include severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Balance identifying problems with recognizing good implementations
- Reference previous reviews to show progression
- Use technical language appropriate for Unity developers

## Workflow Integration

### Review Triggers
Generate reviews for:
- Major feature implementations
- Significant refactoring efforts
- Architecture modifications
- Pre-integration checkpoints
- Technical debt assessment
- Platform-specific development

### Historical Context
- Always check for previous reviews in this directory
- Track progress on previously identified issues
- Note recurring patterns or persistent problems
- Build upon previous findings to show development evolution

### Template

```markdown

```

## Directory Purpose

This directory serves as:
- Historical record of codebase evolution
- Input for development planning and prioritization
- Knowledge base for understanding technical decisions
- Foundation for tracking progress between development cycles

Each review should stand alone while building upon previous reviews to create a comprehensive understanding of the project's technical trajectory.
